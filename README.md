## Simple Chat Application with Golang + React

First time using Go! Including the following that helped setup the backend structure
* [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
* [Melody](https://github.com/olahol/melody/)

#### Setup
* Install Golang: https://golang.org/doc/install
* `go install`
* `yarn` or `npm install`
* `npm install -g webpack`
* `webpack`
* `go-react-chat-app`
* Go to localhost:5000 and use the chat!
